``robupy``  is an open-source Python package for finding worst-case probabilities in
the context of robust decision making. It aims to collect algorithms, which find for
different construction methods for the ambiguity set, the worst-case distribution as
fast as possible.

The first algorithm implemented, applies to an ambiguity set constructed with the
Kullback-Leibler divergence function. It reduces the selection to a one-dimensional
minimization problem. This algorithm was developed and described in:

    Nilim, A., \& El Ghaoui, L. (2005). `Robust control of Markov decision processes
    with uncertain transition matrices <https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.1050.0216>`_.
    *Operations Research*, 53(5):  780â€“798.

You can install ``robupy`` via conda with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install -c opensourceeconomics robupy
