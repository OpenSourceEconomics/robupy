``robupy``  is an open-source Python package for finding worst-case probabilites in
the context of robust decision making. It implements an algorithm, which reduces the
selection to a one-dimensional minimization problem. This algorithm was developed and
described in:

    Nilim, A., \& El Ghaoui, L. (2005). `Robust control of Markov decision processes
    with uncertain transition matrices. <https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.1050.0216>`_.
    *Operations Research*, 53(5):  780â€“798.

You can install ``robupy`` via conda with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install -c opensourceeconomics robupy
